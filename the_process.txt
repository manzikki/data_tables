Create file test.txt that contains just hotel id's one per line.

python p2.py > a
p2.py takes test.txt as its input and calls the API for each line.
Now you have the JSON in the file a.

python3 conv2relp3.py > inserts.sql
It's important to use Python 3 to get UTF-8 correctly.
conv2relp3.py uses the file "a". It creates datadata insert statement.
Additionally, it creates a file latlon.txt that contains locations from "a".

Generate addresses from latlon using reverse geocoding:

while read line; do echo $line >> addr.txt ; geocode \"$line\"  --provider arcgis --method reverse >> addr.txt; done < latlon.txt

Convert the data in addr.txt into database updates:
python3 convG2relp3.py > updates.sql
Again, use python3 to get correct UTF-8.

Now, create the database using the create.txt file from this directory.
Run inserts.sql
Run updates.sql
